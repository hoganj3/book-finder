# Book Finder
Some code for a book-finding application I made which uses computer vision techniques to locate specific books in images of bookshelves

The code was deployed in an iOS application named 'shelfie', hence the name of the C++ file in this repo.

I wrote a report / thesis on my research and work in developing this application, which is found here in the PDF file 'Book Finder Report'
